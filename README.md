# DuckDuckGo Bang CLI Utility (A Fork from [t3dotgg/unduck](https://github.com/t3dotgg/unduck))

A simple command-line utility written in TypeScript to generate DuckDuckGo Bang redirect URLs, designed for easy integration with tools like Rofi on Linux.

## Features

* Generate DuckDuckGo URLs from bang commands (e.g., `!g my search`).
* Outputs the resulting URL to standard output.
* Convenient for scripting and integrating with launchers like Rofi.


## Usage Example
- I use unduck.sh for interactive use with Rofi and opening in default browser. I have a keybinding for it.
